This is a simple DarkRP Mining addon which allows your players to earn money by mining!
You can! Just edit the config file located in sleepy_mining/lua/autorun/sleepy_config.lua

To place the rocks simply spawn them in from Q -> Entities, once you are happy with where they are placed just type "mining_saverocks" in console

To delete all rocks from your map, type "mining_deleteallrocks" in console.
